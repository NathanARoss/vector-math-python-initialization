Run this .py file as your PYTHONSTARTUP file to set up ergonomic aliases for numpy

This python file relies on numpy being installed first.  Install that library using whatever means are best for your development environment.  Ubuntu has it available from apt, so run "sudo apt install python-numpy" if that is your platform.
